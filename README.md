# Rubix Decentralized Identity
Rubix Decentralized IDentity (DID) project is an open standard enabling users to create self-owned identities, and use blockchain network for getting decentralized tamper proof verifiable claims. The claims are 100% on-chain and publicly verifiable.

## Features
1. Self-created and self-owned identities allowing more control for user over his data
2.  Cryptographically Immutable Information
3.  Real world DFS based on content-based addressing preserves complete integrity over signed data
4.  Parallel scalable ledger allows asynchronous claims and verification
5.  Instant confirmation and finality
6.  Data confidentiality is preserved by using patented Non-Linear Secret Sharing (NLSS) method
7.  In Compliance with globally accepted standards like
     [IMS Open Badges](https://www.imsglobal.org/sites/default/files/Badges/OBv2p0/index.html)
    [W3C Verifiable Claims](https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/)
     [W3C Linked Data Signatures](https://w3c-dvcg.github.io/ld-signatures/)
8.  Follows digital preservation rules like GDPR, CCPA
9.  All transactions are on-chain (no Layer 2 protocols)
10.  Light weight infrastructure with support for multi architectural designs
